# Canadian Election Prediction Analysis

Welcome to the Canadian Election Prediction Analysis repository. This project aims to predict Canada's Federal Election popular vote using advanced statistical techniques. We utilized Multi-level Multiple Logistic Regression and Post-Stratification methodologies to make informed predictions. Surprisingly, our analysis challenges the hypothesis that the Liberals will maintain power, projecting their vote percentage to be around 20%, indicating a potential shift in government control.

## Data Sources

- **General Social Survey (GSS)** Census data offers demographic insights such as income, age, gender, province, education, and minority status. Census Data is obtained from the CHASS website

- **Canadian Election Study (CES)**: Data provides information on voter behavior. Combining multi-level multiple logistic regression and post-stratification, this analysis aims to predict the outcome of the next Canadian Federal Election and identify potential voter patterns and party performance. Data can be accessed through resources provided by the CES project and its documentation.

## Key Findings and Conclusion

Our analysis concludes that the Liberals' projected vote percentage challenges expectations, potentially indicating a change in government power. The prediction, around 20%, deviates significantly from Justin Trudeau's 31.5% victory in the 2021 Election. Thus, we reject the initial hypothesis of the Liberals maintaining power. This analysis offers insights for future election predictions and campaign strategies. Despite limitations, this model provides a solid foundation for predicting election outcomes and guiding political campaigns.
